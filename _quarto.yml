  title: "Sample Size Help"
  description: |
    In recent years the popularity of procedures to collect intensive
    longitudinal data such as the Experience Sampling Method has increased
    immensely. The goal of this workshop is to address this crucial question by
    presenting methodological advances for sample size planning for intensive
    longitudinal designs.
