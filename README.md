## üìù Description

In recent years the popularity of procedures to collect intensive longitudinal
data such as the Experience Sampling Method has increased immensely. The data
collected using such designs allow researchers to study the dynamics of
psychological processes, and how these dynamics differ across individuals. A
fundamental question when designing a study is how to determine the sample size,
which is closely related to the replicability and generalizability of empirical
findings. Even though multiple statistical guidelines are available for sample
size planning, it still remains a demanding enterprise in complex designs. The
goal of this workshop is to address this crucial question by presenting
methodological advances for sample size planning for intensive longitudinal
designs. First, we provide an overview of methods for sample size planning with
special emphasis on a priori power analysis. Second, we focus on how to conduct
power analysis in the $N = 1$ case when the goal is to model within-person
processes using $\text{VAR}(1)$ models. Subsequently, we consider the extension
to multilevel data in which multiple individuals are measured over time. We
introduce an approach for conducting power analysis for multilevel models that
explicitly accounts for the temporal dependencies that characterize the data
collected in IL studies. In addition, we showcase how to perform power analysis
for these models using a user-friendly and open-source application. Finally, we
consider an alternative criterion for conducting sample size planning that
targets the predictive accuracy of a model for unseen data. Focusing on
$\text{VAR}(1)$ models in an $N = 1$ context, we introduce a novel approach,
called predictive accuracy analysis, to assess how many measurement occasions
are required in order to optimize predictive accuracy.
